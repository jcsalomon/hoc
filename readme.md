Hoc: A _Higher Order Calculator_
==================================

Hoc interprets a simple language for floating point arithmetic, at about the level of BASIC, with C-like syntax and functions.

The code is based on that in _The Unix Programming Environment_ by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike; see [Kernighan’s home page][bwk] and the [Plan 9 source][plan9] for some later improvements.  [Wikipedia][wiki] has pointers to other extended versions.
